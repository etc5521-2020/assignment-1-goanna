# Introduction and motivation

Bushfires that raged in Australia from September 2019 to early 2020 captured the attention of people worldwide, especially the out-of-control bushfires in New South Wales. However, looking at the Australian bushfires' history data, we can find that Australia suffers from different degrees and quantities of bushfires every year. It is exciting to explore the link between Australian fire history and climate change. What climate conditions caused the frequent occurrence of the bushfires in Australia?    
This analysis aims to explore three secondary questions for the primary research question:   
- When and where were the most widespread fires burning?   
- Was temperature to be blamed for bushfires in Australia?   
- Was rainfall to be blamed for bushfires in Australia?  
  
The rest of the analysis proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the data description. Section 3 details the findings in data analysis. The limitations of the analysis are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusions of this analysis.   

# Data description

This section mainly introduces the data, data sources and data description.  
There are three data sets used on this analysis, and the cleaned data is obtained from [GitHub tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/readme.md).  

```{r read-data}
# please find the data cleaning code in *data-cleaning code script.R*
nasa_fire <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data/2020-01-07/fire_archive_M6_147063.csv")) %>% select(-instrument,-type)
temperature <- read.csv(here::here("data/2020-01-07/temperature_new.csv"))
rainfall <- read.csv(here::here("data/2020-01-07/rainfall_new.csv"))
```

## Australua fire data

The `fire` data source is from [NASA](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/)[@nasa] "Active Fires Dataset" via the MODIS fire product collection. MODIS active fire product is detected the fire data in every 5 minutes and collected through each tile with horizontal and vertical coordinate. The data contains the fire information of Australia with `r nrow(nasa_fire)` observations from 2000-11-01 to 2020-01-05. The variables information included in the data are as the following table:  

```{r fire-data, message=FALSE}
fire_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("latitude", "longitude", "brightness", "scan", 
               "track", "acq_date", "act_time", "satellite", 
               "confidence", "version", "dbright_t31","frq", "day_night"),
  Description = c("Center of 1km fire pixel but not necessarily the actual location of the fire as one or more fires can be detected within the 1km pixel.", 
                  "Center of 1km fire pixel but not necessarily the actual location of the fire as one or more fires can be detected within the 1km pixel.", 
                  "Channel 21/22 brightness temperature of the fire pixel measured in Kelvin.", 
                  "The algorithm produces 1km fire pixels but MODIS pixels get bigger toward the edge of scan. Scan and track reflect actual pixel size.", 
                  "The algorithm produces 1km fire pixels but MODIS pixels get bigger toward the edge of scan. Scan and track reflect actual pixel size.",
                  "Date of MODIS acquisition.",
                  "Time of acquisition/overpass of the satellite (in UTC).",
                  "A = Aqua and T = Terra.",
                  "This value is based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process. It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence estimates range between 0 and 100% and are assigned one of the three fire classes (low-confidence fire, nominal-confidence fire, or high-confidence fire).",
                  "Version identifies the collection (e.g. MODIS Collection 6) and source of data processing: Near Real-Time (NRT suffix added to collection) or Standard Processing (collection only).

## Climate data

For climate data, temperature and rainfall was gathered from the Australian [Bureau of Meterology (BoM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/?ref=logo), of which is used the weather station to measure a variety of aspects of the weather. `Rainfall` data was sourced from six major Australian cities: Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney,Brisbane and Canberra, and the cleaned data is obtained from [GitHub tidytuesday](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/rainfall.csv), which is from 1858-01-01 to 2020-01-06.   
The `temperature` data is divided into two parts, with the cleaned data obtained directly from [GitHub tidytuesday](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/temperature.csv), which is from 1910-01-01 to 2019-05-31. And we found the time range of the cleaned `temperature` data cannot match the `fire` data, in order to further analysis of the relationship between the fire and the temperature, we decided to download the new temperature data from the [source website](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml??zoom=1&lat=-26.9635&lon=133.4635&layers=B0000TFFFFFFFFFTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTT&dp=IDC10001&p_nccObsCode=201&p_display_type=dailyDataFile), and cleaned it to obtain the new data from 2019-06-01 to 2020-01-05. Finally, the new data were merge with the Github data to produce a final `temperature` data from 1910-01-01 to 2020-01-05. Also, there are seven weather stations were chosen, based on seven Australian cities such as  Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Lincoln and Canberra.  

The climate data structure is shown as the below tables.

# Analysis and findings

## Fires

## The higher the temperature, the more bushfires

Were bushfires more likely to happen with higher temperatures in Australia? In this section, we will explore the relationship between the two in-depth.   

```{r temp}
temperature <- temperature %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) 
```

```{r temp-yearly}
# calculate annual mean temperature
temp_year <- temperature %>% 
  filter(temp_type == "max") %>% 
  filter(year <= 2019) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(temperature,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(time = paste0(year, "-01-01"),
         time = as.Date(time)) 
```

```{r temp-yearly-plot,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Annual average temperature trends from 1910 to 2019, calculated by daily maximum temperature"}
# prepare time series data
temp_year_dat <- xts(x = temp_year$avg, order.by = temp_year$time)

# time series plot
dygraph(temp_year_dat) %>%
  dyOptions(labelsUTC = TRUE, 
            fillGraph=TRUE, 
            fillAlpha=0.15, 
            drawGrid = FALSE, 
            colors="#EED5D2") %>%
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("2000-01-01", "2019-01-01"),
                  height = 50,
                  fillColor = "#BFEFFF",) %>%
  dyCrosshair(direction = "vertical") %>%
  dyHighlight(highlightCircleSize = 5, 
              highlightSeriesBackgroundAlpha = 0.1, 
              hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)  %>%
  dyRoller(rollPeriod = 1)

```
As a first step, we calculated the annual average temperature from 1910 to 2019 and drew a time series plot. From the Figure \@ref(fig:temp-yearly-plot), it can be seen that the average temperature in 2019 is significantly higher than in other years. A strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomenon was the culprit[@harris2019understanding], and contributed to very high temperature and low rainfall across Australia[@bureau2019annual], which began in May 2019 and lasted until the end of the year.   

```{r plot1, fig.cap= 'Indian Ocean Dipole: positive phase. Source from Australian BOM.', out.width = '60%', out.height='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/iod-positive.png")
```
  
However, how big is the difference between the temperature in 2019 and other years? Has it reached dangerous standards?   
Therefore, we calculated the annual average temperature from 1961 to 1990, which is the baseline used by the Australian BOM to compare annual average temperature difference. From the Figure \@ref(fig:temp-diff), we can find that from 1910 to mid-1950, the annual average temperature of almost all years was lower than the baseline, but since the late 1950s, it was higher than the baseline. Although there have been sporadic years of unusual trends, it does not affect the overall trend. Also, it is worth noting that 2019 is significantly higher than in other years, with a difference of above 1.5 degrees Celsius. As BOM sates, 2019 was Australia's warmest year on record, surpassing the previous record of +1.35°C in 2013[@bureau2019annual].  
Since the 1970s, the rising average annual temperature has been a warning that Global warming is a growing problem. Moreover, Global warming brings many catastrophic disasters, among which bushfires are one of them. As the global temperature rises more, humans and nature will encounter more disasters. The average temperature in Australia has risen by 1 degree Celsius since the industrial period, which is one of the reasons why bushfires were so frequently occurred in Australia and raged in 2019[@council2019not].   

```{r baseline}
# mean temperature from 1961 to 1990, follow the baseline selected by the Australian BOM
meanTemp <- temperature %>% 
  filter(temp_type == "max") %>% 
  filter(year >= 1961 & year <= 1990) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(temperature, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r themes}

themes_p <- theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
                  axis.title.y=element_blank(),

Figure \@ref(fig:fire-yearly-plot) shows the annual trend of total number of fires in Australia from 2001 to 2019. Compared with Figure \@ref(fig:temp-yearly-plot), the annual total fire occurrences trend fluctuates mostly in a consistent pattern. When the temperature is high, there are generally more fires, and vice versa. However, there are an unexpected fact that the fires occurrence in 2012 ranked first with 474,964, but the annual average temperature in 2012 was relatively low with 22.57°C. We found that the raged bushfires in 2012 that were caused by lightning at the beginning, and lightning was predominantly responsible for the bushfires[@dowdy2012characteristics].   
  
From the above analysis, we can further clarify that the high-temperature weather in 2019 is closely related to bushfires, and high temperature makes forest fuels more susceptible to cause bushfires[@oldenborgh2020attribution].   

```{r temp-site, message=FALSE}
temperature %>% 
  filter(date >= "2019-09-01") %>%
  group_by(city_name) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(temperature, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-avg) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Average annual temperature for each city in 2019") %>%

```

```{r fire-map, message = FALSE, fig.cap="The distribution point for Australian bushfire from 2019-12-29 to 2020-01-05(the darker the color, the more serious the fire)"}
subset <- nasa_fire %>% 
  filter(acq_date == "2019-12-01")

pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "YlOrRd", domain = subset$brightness)

leaflet(data = subset) %>%
   #setView(lng = 153.05, lat = -27.45, zoom = 12) %>% 
    addTiles() %>%
    addCircleMarkers(lat = ~latitude, 
                     lng = ~longitude, 
                     popup = ~brightness, 
                     radius=4,
                     color = ~pal(brightness), 
                     stroke = FALSE, 
                     fillOpacity = 0.6) %>%
    addLegend(position = "bottomleft", pal = pal, values = ~brightness)

```

In this part of the analysis, we concluded that as global warming becomes more serious and temperatures rise, bushfires will become more frequent.   

## Rainfall


# Limitations of analysis

This section mainly introduces two main limitations of this analysis:   
- There is no regional division in the fire data. We have indistinctly divided seven states or regions according to Australia's longitude and latitude, which may lead to bias in the analysis results for location.   
- The temperature and rainfall data include only some major cities, and comparing with the fire data, the sample is too small. Therefore,  the analysis of the link between fires and climate data in Section 3 is not accurate and will cause deviation in results.
